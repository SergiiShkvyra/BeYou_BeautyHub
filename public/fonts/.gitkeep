# Font Files Directory

Place your International Regular font files here:
- International-Regular.woff2 (recommended for modern browsers)
- International-Regular.woff (for broader browser support)
- International-Regular.ttf (fallback for older browsers)

The font files should be named exactly as referenced in the CSS @font-face declaration.
